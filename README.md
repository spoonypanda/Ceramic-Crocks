# Ceramic Crocks
 Ceramic Crocks, a small and primitive storage mod for Minecraft 1.20.1!
 
 Make unfired crocks with clay.
 Cook it in the furnace.
 Place the crocks and put things in them!
 
 There's a small and large one. Small one has 6 slots, large has 12.
 Items stay in the crock on break. Tooltips will tell you how full it is.
 As an extra fun little bonus, you can dye them with dyes by sneak right clicking with a dye in hand.
 
 Made for modpacks where you need some primitive storage early on, inspired by TFC/Vintage Story.
